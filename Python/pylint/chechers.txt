Jeff Bay's Object Calisthenics Rules

1. One level of indentation per method
   * Pylint's "refactoring", max-nested-blocks=1
     - also catches NoElse.
   * stronger would be Pylint's "design", max-branches=1
   * DONE

2. Don’t use the ELSE keyword
   * custom "no-else"
   * DONE

3. Wrap all primitives and Strings

4. First class collections

5. One dot per line

6. Don’t abbreviate
   * ---

7. Keep all entities small (no class over 50 lines, no package over 10 files)

8. No classes with more than two instance variables
   * custom "two-instance-variables"
   * DONE

9. No getters/setters/properties
